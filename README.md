## ü§ñ Project Overview
Greetings, Pok√©mon Trainers! üéâ

We are thrilled to present My Pok√©App, a powerful tool designed to enhance your Pok√©mon journey by providing insights beyond the capabilities of your traditional Pok√©dex.

Our objective is the following :

1 - Enabling the possibility for pok√©trainers to take a picture of a Pok√©mon, and determine automatically its type based on how it looks thanks to Deep Learning

2 - Determining the catchability of a pok√©mon based on its statistics thanks to Machine Learning

## üì∏ Deep Learning Project : Pokemon type classification (computer vision)

### Data sources
We used a dataset comprising 809 images sourced from Kaggle, accessible [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vishalsubbiah/pokemon-images-and-types). This dataset encompasses the initial 809 Pok√©mon, spanning generations 1 to 7, complete with their respective images and types. Notably, certain Pok√©mon possess dual types, exemplified by creatures like Moltres, a Fire and Flying type.

Furthermore, we conducted web scraping on [Bulbapedia](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_by_National_Pok%C3%A9dex_number) to augment our dataset, yielding a substantial collection of 42,000 images categorized by Pok√©mon type.

### Methodology
In the preprocessing phase, we employed one-hot encoding for each Pok√©mon type, resulting in 18 distinct categories.

Additionally, we developed functions to systematically organize each Pok√©mon image into its corresponding type folder. This process accommodated cases where a Pok√©mon had dual types, necessitating the duplication of its image. We also implemented functions to automate the creation of train/test datasets, with 80% of the images allocated to the training set and 20% to the testing set.

Following these preparations, we experimented with various models, including Inception V3, VGG16, and ResNet50.

### Models & metrics
we chose resnet in the end
(description des layers dans le CNN)

### Results
40% accuracy

### Difficulties & improvements' ideas
some pokemons look like shit (example : Klefki)
too much pokemons in some types (exemple : water), hypothesis we should maybe have the same nb of images for each types next time
maybe we should have created folders for hybrid pokemons
