## ðŸ¤– Project Overview
Greetings, PokÃ©mon Trainers! ðŸŽ‰

We are thrilled to present My PokÃ©App, a powerful tool designed to enhance your PokÃ©mon journey by providing insights beyond the capabilities of your traditional PokÃ©dex.

Our objective is the following :

1 - Enabling the possibility for pokÃ©trainers to take a picture of a PokÃ©mon, and determine automatically its type based on how it looks thanks to Deep Learning

2 - Determining the catchability of a pokÃ©mon based on its statistics thanks to Machine Learning

## ðŸ“¸ Deep Learning Project : Pokemon type classification (computer vision)

### Data sources
We used a dataset of 809 images from Kaggle, available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vishalsubbiah/pokemon-images-and-types).

This dataset contains the first 809 pokÃ©mons, which represents the generation 1 to 7.

In addition, we scraped [Bulbapedia](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_by_National_Pok%C3%A9dex_number) in order to get a higher amount of images per type of pokÃ©mon, and we ended up with 42,000 thousand images.

### Methodology
cleaning : fonctions pour trier les images dans des dossiers par type, dupliquer les images si pokemon existant dans 2 types, split du train et test set, et preprocessing pour resizer toutes les images et leur appliquer des filtres
preprocessing : OHE pour chaque catÃ©gorie

we tried inception V3 model, vgg16, resnet

### Models & metrics
we chose resnet in the end
(description des layers dans le CNN)

### Results
40% accuracy

### Difficulties & improvements' ideas
some pokemons look like shit (example : Klefki)
too much pokemons in some types (exemple : water), hypothesis we should maybe have the same nb of images for each types next time
maybe we should have created folders for hybrid pokemons
